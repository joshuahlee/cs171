            The audience are those who might be interested in working at Google
            or are interested in benchmarking salaries to Google or between
            different positions at the firm. The question that the infographic
            answers are "How much do different positions at Google make?". The
            data is mainly categorical and quantitative. Breaking that down more
            specifically, the categorical data are the position types where as
            the numerical quantitative data is split up between a lower bound
            and a higher bound to produce a range of expected income. The data
            also ranks each position by the lower bound going from highest being
            1 to the lowest being 10. The data is visually encoded by color
            coding the positions to the income range along with a corresponding
            slice of the middle graph. A specific thing that I like about this
            visual is that it is clear which positions make how much money. The
            one thing that can be clarified is what the corresponding slice in
            the middle represents. There are no legends that describe what the
            center circle should be interpreted as, and because the slices are
            over lapping and don't make a whole it makes it confusing to
            understand the significance of the slices in relationship to other
            slices and the whole graph. My assumption of what the center part
            represents is that the area corresponds to how much money goes to
            paying those specific positions in relation to others however that
            is not made very clear.
